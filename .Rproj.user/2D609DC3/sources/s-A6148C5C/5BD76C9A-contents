\title{LBL: Bayesian Lasso for detecting Rare (or Common) Haplotype Association}
\description{
LBL features a Bayesian LASSO model detects association between
a phenotype and haplotypes given the (unphased) genotypes of an individual.
}
\details{
LBL puts a double exponential prior on the regression coefficients, effectively penalizing
unassociated hapltoypes while enhancing the stability and accuracy of the rare
haplotypes.LBL is capable of handling different study designs: this versio of the software is capable
of handling independent cases and control, case-parent trios and a mixture of both (provided
that the family data is independent from the population data). LBL does not provide haplotype
imputation. Instead, the imputation is handled by \pkg{\link[hapassoc:pre.hapassoc]{hapassoc}}
package.

The posterior samples are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm and inference on the parameters of interests can be carried out
(Bayes Factor, Confidence Interval, etc.) based on the posterior samples.
