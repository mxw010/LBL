Description: LBL imposes a double exponential prior on the regression coefficients, effectively penalizing
    unassociated hapltoypes while enhancing the stability and accuracy of the rare
    haplotypes. LBL is capable of handling different study designs: this version of the software is capable
    of handling independent cases and controls, case-parent trios and a mixture of both (provided
    that the family data is independent from the case-control data). LBL uses algorithms from
    \pkg{\link[hapassoc:pre.hapassoc]{hapassoc}} to obtain all possible haplotype pairs compatible with an
    indivdiual's genotype.
