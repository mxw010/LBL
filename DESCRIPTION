Description: LBL puts a double exponential prior on the regression coefficients, effectively penalizing
    unassociated hapltoypes while enhancing the stability and accuracy of the rare
    haplotypes.LBL is capable of handling different study designs: this versio of the software is capable
    of handling independent cases and control, case-parent trios and a mixture of both (provided
    that the family data is independent from the population data). LBL does not provide haplotype
    imputation. Instead, the imputation is handled by \pkg{\link[hapassoc:pre.hapassoc]{hapassoc}}
    package.
