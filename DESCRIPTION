Title: Logistic Bayesian Lasso for identifying genetic association between common diseases and rare haplotypes
Version: 0.9.0
Description: LBL uses Bayesian Lasso to detect rare haplotypes that are associated with common diseases. The current implementation considers dichotomous traits. A future release will include quantitative and survival traits. LBL is capable of handling different study designs: this version of the software is capable of handling independent cases and controls, case-parent trios and a mixture of both (provided that the family data is independent of the case-control data). LBL uses algorithms from pre.hapassoc function from hapassoc package to obtain all possible haplotype pairs compatible with an indivdiual's set of genotypes.
